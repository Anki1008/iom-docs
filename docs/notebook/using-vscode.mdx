# Using Visual Studio Code

Coming soon...

## Customizing Spark Environment

To customize the Spark environment in Jupyter Notebook, you can modify the Spark configuration properties.
These properties control various aspects of Spark's behavior, such as the memory allocation,
the number of cores to use, and the log level.

You can modify the Spark configuration properties by creating a SparkConf object and setting
the properties you want to modify. For example, to set the log level to WARN, you can use
the following code:

```python
from pyspark.conf import SparkConf
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

conf = SparkConf().set("spark.log.level", "WARN")
spark = SparkSession.builder.config(conf=conf).getOrCreate()
```

## Accessing to SparkSession

To access the SparkSession in Python code, you can use the SparkSession.builder method
to create a new session. Once you have a session, you can use it to create DataFrames,
read data from various sources, and execute SQL queries.

For example, to create a DataFrame from a CSV file, you can use the following code:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("MyApp").getOrCreate()
df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("mydata.csv")
```

## Installing additional libraries

To install additional Python libraries in Jupyter Notebook, you can use pip to install the libraries.
For example, to install the NumPy library, you can use the following command:

```python
!pip install numpy
```

This will install the NumPy library and its dependencies

## Requesting new Kernel

If you need a Jupyter kernel with specific libraries or plugins preinstalled, you can
request a custom kernel from Jupyter support. This can be useful if you have specialized
requirements or need to work with specific data sources or tools.

To request a custom kernel, you will need to provide the details of the libraries or
plugins you need to be installed. Jupyter support will then create a custom kernel that includes
these dependencies.

Having a custom kernel with preinstalled libraries can save you time and effort,
as you won't need to install and configure these dependencies manually.
This can be especially useful if you are working with a large number of libraries or
need to switch between different environments frequently.
