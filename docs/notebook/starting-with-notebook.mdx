Jupyter Notebook is a powerful tool for interactive data exploration and prototyping.
By connecting to IOMETE's Jupyter Gateway you will be able to explore and analyze data stored in IOMETE's data lake
directly from your local environment.

## Installing Jupyter Clients

There are a lot of Jupyter clients that you can use to connect to Jupyter Gateway.
To quickstart we will provide installation instruction for official web-based client Jupyter Lab. For more detailed information please refer to [official website](https://jupyter.org/install).

To install Jupyter Notebook on your local machine, you can use pip (Python Package Installer).
Open your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

Once the installation is complete you will need to connect to Jupyter Gateway provided by IOMETE. Please follow the instructions below.

P.S: We recommend to use Visual Stuido Code as your Jupyter Client. For more information read [this](/using-vscode).

## Connecting to Jupyter Gateway

Jupyter Gateway is used to manage Jupyter kernels and provide access to remote kernels.
To connect to a Jupyter Gateway, you will need to specify the gateway URL and token.  
Go to [IOMETE Console app](https://app.iomete.com) → Notebook menu → Copy connection string as in screenshot below

The `--gateway-url` is different for each workspace.  
Below you can find a template for connection string depending on your client.

<Question title="Jupyter Lab">
Replace values in the template. You can find them in your IOMETE Console app.

```bash
jupyter-lab --gateway-url=GATEWAY_URL \
  --GatewayClient.request_timeout=180 \
  --GatewayClient.auth_token=TOKEN
```

## Kernels Overview

Currently IOMETE supports 2 python-based kernels. Creating custom kernels will be available soon.

1. Pyspark Kernel
2. Python Kernel with pre-intsalled Mongo libraries

<ImgBorder src="/img/jupyter/kernels.png" alt="Available Kernels" />

When starting/selecting a kernel the Spark driver will be deployed in the background. This process may take up to 2 minutes. Please be patient.
You can track the status of kernel from client UI or from IOMETE Console app under the section "Active Kernels".

<ImgBorder src="/img/jupyter/active-kernels.png" alt="Active Kernels" />

By default kernels are terminated after closing the client. You can do it manually from IOMETE Console app.

:::caution
For cost-saving purposes it is strongly recommended to make sure that you closed the client, after finishing your job, and no kernels are running.
