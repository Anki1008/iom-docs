## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive list of AWS permissions required to run IOMETE's Data Plane Terraform Script.

The permissions encompass the creation and management of various AWS resources, including Amazon EKS clusters, VPC components, S3 buckets, Key Management Service (KMS) keys, and more.

:::info
These permissions are essential to enable the user to successfully execute the Terraform script and should be granted by the Security team.
:::

:::info
IOMETE only interacts with AWS resources that it creates. It does not modify or delete any resources that it did not create. See [#1](#1-restricting-permissions-using-tags) for more details.
:::

## Resources and Required Permissions

### VPC

IOMETE creates a dedicated VPC for the resources it creates. This VPC contains the following resources:
- Subnets
- NAT
- INTERNET GW
- LoadBalancer
- EKS
- EC2 instances


### EKS
EKS cluster contains compute resources like: Lakehouse cluster, Spark driver and executers, and system services.

### S3 Lakehouse Buckets

IOMETE creates S3 buckets to store lakehouse data and cluster assets. These buckets are encrypted using KMS keys.

### SQS
EKS Karpenter Module (kubernetes autoscaler) requires access to SQS to create and manage queues.

### CloudWatch

IOMETE terraform script creates CloudWatch log groups to store logs from the data plane.

:::info
Can be disabled
:::

### IAM Roles and policies

Terraform creates IAM roles and policies to allow the EKS cluster to access to:
- Lakehouse S3 buckets and objects
- To create and manage EC2 resources for EKS Node Groups
- To create and manage SQS queues for EKS Karpenter Module (kubernetes autoscaler)
- KMS keys to encrypt S3 buckets


## Implementation Notes

### Restricting Permissions Using Tags

IOMETE adds the tag `"iomete.com/managed": true` to each resource it creates. This tag can be used to restrict permissions to only the resources created by IOMETE. This is a powerful way to ensure that the permissions are restricted to only the necessary resources.

#### Example Policy

Here's an example policy statement that allows actions on resources only if they have the `iomete.com/managed` tag with a value of `true`:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:DescribeInstances", // Adjust this to your required actions
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:RequestTag/iomete.com/managed": "true"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

You'll need to apply this condition to all relevant actions in the IAM policies that are needed by the IOMETE Terraform script.



### Controlling Access Using AWS Organizational Units (OUs) and AWS Organizations

:::info
This is the recommended approach for controlling access to IOMETE's Terraform script.
:::

AWS Organizations allows you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization to achieve centralized management. Within this organization, you can create Organizational Units (OUs) to further segment and categorize accounts. By using OUs, Security teams can exercise more granular control over permissions for users running specific scripts like IOMETE's terraform script.

Here's how you can apply this control:

1. **Create an OU for IOMETE Terraform Users**: Group the accounts where the IOMETE terraform script will be run into a dedicated OU. This isolation allows you to apply specific policies without affecting other accounts in the organization.

2. **Define Service Control Policies (SCPs)**: SCPs allow you to set fine-grained permissions for the accounts within an OU. By defining SCPs, you can restrict the actions that users within the OU can perform.

3. **Utilize Tag-Based Controls**: Since IOMETE's terraform script adds the tag `"iomete.com/managed": true` to each resource it creates, you can include tag-based conditions in the SCPs. This ensures that the permissions apply only to the resources tagged by IOMETE's script.

#### Example of SCP with Tag-Based Control

Below is an example of an SCP that restricts actions to only those resources tagged with `"iomete.com/managed": true`.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "IOMETETagBasedControl",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:RequestTag/iomete.com/managed": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: The exact details and implementation might vary based on the specific requirements and constraints of your organization's security policies.
