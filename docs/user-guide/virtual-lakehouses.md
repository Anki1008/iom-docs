A virtual **lakehouse** is a cluster of compute resources that provide the required resources, such as CPU, memory to perform the querying processing. Table data files are stored in cloud data storage (S3) as a shared data storage that allows multiple virtual lakehouse clusters to share the same data while isolating compute. IOMETE uses Apache Spark as a data lakehouse query engine with ACID support

---

:::info
In production environments, it is often required to isolate workloads, for example, to avoid the overhead of batch ETL jobs on ad-hoc analytical queries. Since data is decoupled and shared from virtual lakehouse, it enables the creation of multiple lakehouse clusters to isolate the workloads and turn on/off clusters based on requirements to save costs. Cluster size can be defined based on requirements and workloads.

## **Create a new Lakehouse**

**1.** Go to the **Lakehouses** and click the <button className="button button--primary button-iom"><Plus size={16}/>Create</button> button
<Img src="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouses.png" srcDark="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouses-dark.png" alt="Lakehouses"/>
<br />

**2.** Give the new **lakehouse** a name under **Name**.
<Img src="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouse-create.png" srcDark="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouse-create-dark.png"  alt="Create Lakehouse" />
<br />

**3.** SelectÂ driver, under the **Node driver** section.
<Img src="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouse-driver.png" srcDark="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouse-driver-dark.png" alt="Lakehouse driver" maxWidth="500px" />

:::info Node driver
Spark driver is running all the time until lakehouse stopped manually. Driver is responsible for managing executors/workers and connections. If stopped, no connections could be established to the lakehouse.
:::
<br />

**4.** SelectÂ executor, under the **Node executor** section. [Read more](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/cluster-overview.html) about spark executors.
<Img src="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouse-executor-select.png" srcDark="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouse-executor-select-dark.png" alt="Lakehouse executor select" maxWidth="500px" />

<br/>

**5.** InputÂ executor count, under the **Executor count** section.

Below these inputs, a real-time preview of **Total CPU** and **Total Memory** is provided. This information helps you make informed decisions about the selection of Node Executors and the number of Executors. It ensures that you allocate sufficient resources to meet the demands of your workload.

<!-- Use this preview information to optimize the performance of your lakehouse by selecting the right combination of Node Executors and Executor counts. -->

:::info Node executor
Executors basically are responsible for executing the queries. They will be scaled up and down automatically based on the auto-suspend parameter.

Keep **auto-suspend on** to minimize lakehouse costs.

<!-- **3.** Under the **Type** section, choose **type**.
<Img src="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouse-type.png" alt="Create Lakehouse | Type" maxWidth="500px" />

:::info

**6.** Set Auto suspend under **Auto suspend** section.

By clicking checkbox in the left side we can **disabled Auto suspend** functionality.

:::info
Executors will be scaled down after the specified time of inactivity. Executors will be scaled up automatically on demand (Scale up time around 10-15 seconds). It is recommended to keep auto-suspend on to minimize monthly costs.

<br />

**7.** Click the **Create** button after adding a **description** to the **optional description field**.

<br />

ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰Â **Tadaa**! The newly created **test-lakehouse** details view is shown.

## **Lakehouse details**

<Img src="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouse-info.png" srcDark="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouse-info-dark.png" alt="Lakehouse Details" />

1.  Navigation buttons
    - **Spark UI** - this button will take us Spark Jobs information.
    - **Edit** - this button will take us to the editing form.
    - **Terminate / Start** - buttons for the lakehouse's start and terminate.
2.  **[Lakehouse cluster status](#lakehouse-cluster-statuses)**

## Lakehouse Cluster Statuses

To effectively manage and monitor your lakehouse cluster, you need to understand its two main components: the **Driver** and the **Executors**.

- **Driver** acts as the control center, managing connections and orchestrating tasks
- **Executors** carry out the actual data processing.

### Driver Status

What Each Status Means

- **Starting**: The Driver is booting up.
- **Active**: The Driver is running and ready to accept connections.
- **Stopped**: The Driver is offline and not accepting any connections.
- **Failed**: The Driver couldn't start. Contact support for assistance.

<Img src="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouse-driver-status.png" srcDark="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouse-driver-status-dark.png" alt="Lakehouse Driver status" maxWidth="600px"/>

:::tip Cost Implications
You're only charged for the Driver when it's in the 'Active' state.
:::

### Executor Status

What Each Status Means

- **No running executors**: There is no active executor. This happens when auto-suspend is configured. In this case, when there is no workload for a configured auto-suspend time, the cluster scales down to zero. Executors will scale up automatically based on demand.
- **Pending**: Executors are scheduled to start and waiting for resources to start.
- **Running**: Executors are active and processing data.

#### Status Examples

- **Running 1/4**: One out of four Executors is active. The cluster scales down to save costs when the workload is light.
- **Running 1/4 Pending 3/4**: One Executor is active, and three are waiting to start due to an increase in workload.
  <Img src="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouse-executor-pending.png"  srcDark="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouse-executor-pending-dark.png" alt="Lakehouse is scaling-up." />
- **Running 4/4**: All Executors are active, and the cluster is at full capacity.
  <Img src="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouse-executor-running.png"  srcDark="/img/user-guide/virtual-lakehouse/lakehouse-executor-running-dark.png" alt="All executors are active" />

:::tip Cost Implications
You're only billed for Executors when they're in the 'Running' state.
:::

### Scaling-Up Timing

By default, scaling up usually takes 1 to 2 minutes, depending on various factors like the cloud provider's response time and resource availability.

:::tip Faster Scaling-Up
In cloud environments, you can utilize IOMETE to establish a **hot pool** of preconfigured resources. This markedly accelerates the scaling process, reducing the scale-up time to a mere 10 to 15 seconds. Contact support to learn more about this feature.
