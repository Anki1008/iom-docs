# API Reference

Welcome to the API documentation. This section provides detailed information about the available API endpoints and how to interact with them securely.

1. **Go to the User Menu**: Click on the user menu in the top left corner of the console.
2. **Click on API Reference**: From the popup, select the `API Reference` button.
