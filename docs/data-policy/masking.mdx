IOMETE allows you to protect sensitive data using data masking. With this feature, you can create policies that mask or anonymize specific columns containing sensitive data, such as **PII**, **PCI**, and **PHI**, dynamically in the query output.

## Mask Conditions

IOMETE provides the mask conditions for the management of fine-grained data masking.
The condition includes the following properties.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ whiteSpace: "nowrap" }}>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ whiteSpace: "nowrap" }}>Select Group</td>
      <td>
        Specify one or more groups for whom this policy should be applied. If no group is specified, you must provide a
        user.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ whiteSpace: "nowrap" }}>Select User</td>
      <td>
        Specify one or more users for whom this policy should be applied. If no user is specified, you must provide a
        group.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ whiteSpace: "nowrap" }}>Masking options</td>
      <td>
        To create a masking filter for the specified users, groups, click <strong>Select Masking Option</strong>, then
        select a masking type: <br />- <strong>Redact</strong> – mask all alphabetic characters with "x" and all numeric
        characters with "n". <br />- <strong>Partial mask</strong>: show last 4 – Show only the last four characters.{" "}
        <br />- <strong>Partial mask</strong>: show first 4 – Show only the first four characters. <br />-{" "}
        <strong>Hash</strong> – Replace all characters with a hash of the entire cell value. <br />-{" "}
        <strong>Nullify</strong> – Replace all characters with a NULL value. <br />- <strong>Unmasked</strong> (retain

## **Use Case: Policy Masking for Phone Number in Customers Table**

Let's use the `customers` table for data-masking feature use cases as well.

This use case focuses on implementing a masking policy for the `phone_number` column within the `customers` table. The objective is to provide a certain level of data privacy while granting access to the data for the public group.

![data masking use](/img/security/masking/data-masking-use-case.png)

## **Policy details**

- Target Table: `customers`
- Target Column: `phone_number`
  ![data masking UI](/img/security/masking/data-masking-ui.png)

**Masking Rule:**

- The policy enforces that members of the public group can only view the last 4 digits of the `phone_number` column.
- All other digits preceding the last 4 should be masked or obfuscated, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected.

**Access Permissions:**

- The public group is granted read access to the `phone_number` column within the `customers` table.
- This allows the `public` group members to view the partially masked phone numbers for customers while ensuring that critical digits are concealed.

## **Query Results**

```sql
SELECT * from default.customers;
```

- **Sample Data Before Applying Masking Policy for public group:**
  Consider a few records in the `customers` table before the masking policy is applied:

- **Sample Data After Applying Masking Policy public group:**
  Once the masking policy is applied, the `phone_number` column will show different results based on the user group's access level.
